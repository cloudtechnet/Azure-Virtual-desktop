# Basic Azure interview questions and answers

### 1. **What is Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)?**
   **Answer:**
   Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is a cloud-based desktop and application virtualization service provided by Microsoft. It enables organizations to deliver a full Windows desktop experience and individual applications to users securely from the cloud. AVD allows multi-session Windows 10/11, optimized for Office 365, and integrated with security and management services.

### 2. **What are the key components of Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   The key components of AVD include:
   - **Host pools**: A collection of virtual machines providing desktops and applications.
   - **App groups**: A collection of apps or desktops assigned to users.
   - **Workspaces**: A grouping mechanism for resources delivered to users.
   - **Azure AD**: Used for identity management.
   - **FSLogix**: User profile management tool that stores user profiles in containers.
   - **Azure Monitor**: For monitoring performance and diagnostics.

### 3. **How is Azure Virtual Desktop different from Remote Desktop Services (RDS)?**
   **Answer:**
   AVD is a fully managed cloud service provided by Microsoft, offering multi-session Windows 10/11, easier scaling, simplified management, and better integration with other Azure services. In contrast, RDS is an on-premises solution that requires management of infrastructure like VMs, storage, and networking.

### 4. **What is the role of FSLogix in Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   FSLogix is used for profile management in AVD. It stores user profiles in a container, enabling faster login times, consistent user experiences, and improved application performance by separating user data from the OS.

### 5. **What are the key benefits of Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   The benefits include:
   - Secure access to corporate resources.
   - Multi-session Windows 10/11 experience.
   - Optimized for Microsoft 365 apps.
   - Scalable and cost-effective.
   - Integration with Azure services like Azure AD and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
   - Easy deployment and management.

### 6. **Can you explain how scaling works in Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   Scaling in AVD is flexible and automated. Host pools can automatically add or remove VMs based on user demand, helping manage costs. This can be done using Azure Auto-scaling, allowing resources to scale up during peak usage and down during off-peak hours.

### 7. **What is the purpose of a host pool in AVD?**
   **Answer:**
   A host pool is a collection of virtual machines configured to provide either a full desktop experience or specific applications to users. Each user or group of users connects to a specific host pool to access their resources.

### 8. **How does Azure Virtual Desktop support multi-session Windows 10/11?**
   **Answer:**
   Azure Virtual Desktop allows multiple users to simultaneously connect to a single Windows 10/11 virtual machine. This multi-session capability is unique to AVD and helps reduce infrastructure costs by sharing VM resources across multiple users.

### 9. **What are the authentication mechanisms available in Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   AVD uses Azure Active Directory for authentication and supports multi-factor authentication (MFA). This enhances security by requiring additional authentication factors beyond just a password.

### 10. **What are the storage options available in Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   Azure Virtual Desktop supports various storage options such as:
   - **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing user profile containers with FSLogix.
   - **Azure Files**: Provides fully managed file shares for profile and data storage.
   - **Managed Disks**: For storing VM data.

### 11. **How do you deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop environment?**
   **Answer:**
   The AVD environment can be deployed using the Azure portal, ARM templates, or PowerShell. The basic steps include:
   - Setting up a virtual network.
   - Creating a host pool.
   - Configuring session hosts (VMs).
   - Creating app groups.
   - Assigning users and workspaces.
   - Publishing resources for user access.

### 12. **What is the difference between personal desktops and pooled desktops in AVD?**
   **Answer:**
   - **Personal desktops**: Each user gets a dedicated VM for their use.
   - **Pooled desktops**: Multiple users share a pool of VMs. Users are dynamically assigned to any available VM from the pool during login.

### 13. **What monitoring tools can be used with Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   Azure Monitor is the primary tool for monitoring AVD environments. It can track performance, user activity, diagnostics, and alerts. Third-party solutions like Citrix Director and Lakeside SysTrack can also be integrated for advanced monitoring.

### 14. **How does AVD integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?**
   **Answer:**
   AVD integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide advanced threat protection, enabling security teams to detect and respond to potential threats on virtual desktops.

### 15. **What licensing is required for Azure Virtual Desktop?**
   **Answer:**
   To use Azure Virtual Desktop, users need the following licenses:
   - **Windows 10/11 Enterprise or Education**: Required for accessing the virtual desktops.
   - **Microsoft 365 E3/E5 or equivalent**: Required for accessing Office 365 apps on AVD.
   - In addition, organizations pay for Azure infrastructure (VMs, storage, networking) consumed by the virtual desktop environment.
